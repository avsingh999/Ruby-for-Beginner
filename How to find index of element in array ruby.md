#How to find index of element in array ruby

*We have an array of 9 numbers*
`a = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]`

*We put the index value at the variable position, for which we use the a.index method.The index of this value is what we want to get.*
`position1 = a.index(8)`

*We show the result*
`puts position1`
