# Getting current date and time in Ruby

Following is the simple example to get current date and time:

```
> time1 = Time.new

> puts "Current Time : " + time1.inspect
```

`Time.now` is a synonym:

```
> time2 = Time.now

> puts "Current Time : " + time2.inspect
```

This will produce the following result:

```
> Current Time : Mon Jun 02 12:02:39 -0700 2008
> Current Time : Mon Jun 02 12:02:39 -0700 2008
```

We can use Time object to get various components of date and time. Following is the example showing the same:


## Components of a Time
```
> time = Time.new

> puts "Current Time : " + time.inspect

> puts time.year    # => Year of the date

> puts time.month   # => Month of the date (1 to 12)

> puts time.day     # => Day of the date (1 to 31 )

> puts time.wday    # => 0: Day of week: 0 is Sunday

> puts time.yday    # => 365: Day of year

> puts time.hour    # => 23: 24-hour clock

> puts time.min     # => 59

> puts time.sec     # => 59

> puts time.usec    # => 999999: microseconds

> puts time.zone    # => "UTC": timezone name
```
